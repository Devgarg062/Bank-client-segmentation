# Clients Segmentation

To gain valuable insights into client segmentation, a variety of unsupervised learning techniques have been explored 🧠✨. We utilized the BankClients.xlsx dataset, which encompasses 5,000 client samples 📊, each described by 18 features including both categorical and numerical data 🔢📈. To better understand the data, we leveraged Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization 🔍🔮.

In addition, we employed several advanced clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, DBSCAN, OPTICS, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) 🔄🔬. These techniques unveiled intriguing patterns and clusters within the data, providing deeper insights into client behavior and segmentation strategies 🚀📉. The results highlight the potential for more tailored and effective approaches in client management and analysis.
